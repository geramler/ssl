Create CSR & Install SSL/TLS Certificate (Keytool)

Step 1: Use Keytool to Create a New Keystore

	Enter the command below:
		
		keytool -genkey -alias <keyname> -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keystore <your_site_name>.jks
		 		 
		In the command above, your_site_name should be the name of the domain you want to secure with 			this SSL/TLS certificate. When ordering a Wildcard certificate, do not include the asterisk (*) 			in the filename (e.g., your_site_name). The asterisk is not a valid keytool character.

		When prompted, create a password for your keystore
	
	Enter yourr SSL/TLS certificate information
		
		When prompted for the first and last name, DO NOT type your first and last name. Instead, type
		the Fully Qualified Domain name FQDN for the site you are securing with this certificate
		(e.g. www.yourdomain.com, mail.yourdomain.com)
		Are you ordering a Wildcard Certificate? Then your FQDN must begin with asterisk (*)
		(eg. *.yourdomain.com)
		
		Enter your Organization information 
		When prompted to verify your information, type y or yes to confirm
		When asked for a "key password for <keyname>", press enter to use the password you just created 
		for the keystore file
		
	Your keystore file, <your_site_name>.jks, is now created in your current working directory
	
2. Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CS) from your New Keystore

	In Keytool, type the following command:
	
		keytool -certreq -alias server -file csr.txt -keystore your_site_name.jks
		
	When prompted, enter the password you created earlier(when you created your new keystore).
	
	In your current directory, csr.txt (e.g., your_site_domain.txt) now contains your CSR.
	
	Save and Back-up your Keystore file

3. Install the Certificate File in your Keystore

	Important: You must install the SSL/TLS Certificate file to the same keystore and under the same alias 		name (e.g., "-alias server") that you used to generate your CSR. If you try to install the certificate 		to a different keystore or under a different alias, the import command will not work.	
	
	Run the command below to import the certificate into your keystore
	
		keytool -import -alias server -file your_site_name.p7b -keystore your_site_name.jks
		
	In the command above, your_site_name.p7b should be the name of the certificate file you downloaded	
	
	You should get a confirmation that the "Certificate reply was installed in keystore".
	
	If you are prompted to trust the certificate, type y or yes.
	
	The installation of this file loads all necessary certificates to your keystore.
